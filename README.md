# Introduction
This is a re-make (not a fork) version of [Github Explorer](https://github.com/trungdq88/github-explorer), made from pure Reactjs with no dataflow management library.

From [Github Explorer](https://github.com/trungdq88/github-explorer), GitHub Explorer is a [Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) that helps you explore GitHub user repositories. This project is created for technology demonstration purpose, experiment how a web app "looks and behaves" like a native app.
